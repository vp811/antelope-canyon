## Resources
* I used the visuallyhidden class from boilerplate that was discussed in one of our lectures. [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)

```
.visuallyhidden {
    border: 0;
    clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
    height: 1px;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
    white-space: nowrap; /* 1 */
}
```

## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus

## Comments
* I changed the font to a more futuristic font and I added the two moons to the Tatooine logo.
